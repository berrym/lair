PROJECT NAME

The Lair

DESCRIPTION

This is a small chat application written in Python 3.
It consists of a server and two client (one console, the other a simple Qt
Gui) scripts.  It uses the selectors module on sockets and sys.stdin
which works fine on *NIX like systems but not as far I as know on Windows.
This is unlikely to change because it is a toy program and I really dont
care if it works on Windows. It uses an AES CBC symmetrical encryption
scheme.

REQUIREMENTS

A recent version of Python 3.  Tested with 3.6+

PyCryptoDomex: pip install pycryptodomex

For the Gui

PyQt5: many ways to install including pip

psutil: pip install psutil
